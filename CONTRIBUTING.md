# Contributing to bioSyntax

Thank you for your interest in contributing to bioSyntax!

**bioSyntax** is a syntax highlighting package for computational biology to bring you intuitively close to your data.

If you would like to contribute to **bioSyntax** on GitHub, please follow this set of guidelines to easily get involved.

## Partipation Guidelines

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), and by participating, you are expected to uphold it as well. Please report unacceptable behaviour to [info at bioSyntax.org](mailto:info@bioSyntax.org), or any of the core developers.

## Current Goals

We currently have a handful of things we would like to accomplish during the Sprint. Have a look at our [current issues](https://github.com/bioSyntax/bioSyntax/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amozsprint2018) to find out more about them.

For background information to help you start building, please refer to our [manual](https://biosyntax.org/dev).

## How to Submit Changes

Once you've figured out where you'd like to contribute:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the **bioSyntax** repository to make your own version of the project that you can use and modify.
2. Make your changes in the GitHub interface or locally on your own machine, with a text editor/IDE of your choice. If you're making big changes that have a lot of dependencies on other files in the **bioSyntax** repository, consider [using branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) for your work. This way, you can keep your repository up-to-date of any other changes made to files that you're using without losing your own work.
3. Once you're done, [submit a pull request](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request). This will let the core developers know you're proposing changes to the project and invites discussion on your changes, in case anything needs to be fixed or improved before committed to the repository.

## How to Report Bugs

We invite you to try out **bioSyntax** and keep an eye out for anything that needs fixing or may cause potential problems in future. Whether it's bugs in the code, errors in content, or even user interface or experience issues, please [report](https://github.com/bioSyntax/bioSyntax/issues) any of these as an issue on the **bioSyntax** repository, so we can all work together to resolve them.

## Communication Channels

Currently, we do not have a forum or mailing list, so please direct any questions you may have to [info at bioSyntax.org](mailto:info@bioSyntax.org), or any of the core developers.
