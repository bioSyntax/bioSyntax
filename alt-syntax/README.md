# Alternative Syntaxes

This folder is a collection of alternative / user defined syntax definitions to expand functionality to best suit your needs. These don't fall into the main 'bioSyntax' theme but are often useful / preferred.

To learn how to develop and submit your own syntax files see: [Development Page](http://biosyntax.org/dev)

### fasta-ORF by @ababaian
Fasta *O*pen *R*eading *F*rame. For dealing with coding sequences (CDS) this syntax recognizes the first `ATG` start codon and alternatively colors each subsequent codon until a STOP codon is reached. No nested ORF support yet.
